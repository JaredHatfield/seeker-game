<h2>How to Play</h2>
Seeker is a online game that is played in real life.  The rules are as follows: You are given a contract lasting  <b>{$contract_length}</b> hours to find a specific person that is also playing the game.  When you find them, they give you their secret you enter it into the website or via text message to complete your contract.  Contracts are assigned randomly so more than one person could have the same target.  If someone else reaches your target before you do, you fail your current contract.  When someone completes a contract where you are the target, you lose your current contract and will need to wait for <b>{$spawn_time}</b> hours before you rejoin the game.  Contracts are given out to eligible players every hour between 10:00 AM and 10:00 PM every day.
